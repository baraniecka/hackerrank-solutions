# Introduction
The main goal of this project is to prepare myself for job interviews for **Junior Java Developer** role.
In June 2023 I've graduated _Java from scratch_ over half a year long bootcamp. I am constantly developing my knowlegde, both theoretically and practically. 
By resolving [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/ "Hackerrank") coding exercises I'm getting better at logical and algorithmic thinking. Moreover, stepping further than delivering ready solutions only,
I also train myself in writing unit tests.
